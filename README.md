# Weather Analysis Overview
The purpose of this project is to review the temperature data on the island of O‘ahu to see if it would be viable for a shop specializing in ice cream and surfing. Our client believes his idea will work as long as the weather corporates. We previously already found on average, O‘ahu has favorable temperatures and precipitation levels. June and December are months our client believes it varies the most and that is where this analysis will focus on.

The analysis will use:
* Python (Sqlalchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
* Data provided in SQLite format


## Results

Based on the analysis I was able to find:

* December on average is colder at 71 degrees vs June’s average of 74 degrees
* Temperatures for both months are typically in the range between 70 degrees to 80 degrees
* Standard deviation during each month is nearly identical at 3.74%

## Summary
The results clearly show that during the months of June and December, temperatures are consistently in the 70’s. This confirms that weather will be a positive factor when determining if our client should move forward with opening his store. Additional queries that the customer should also consider are precipitation levels since O‘ahu is known to have warm weather during the rain and also to also confirm how many weather stations reported the data.
